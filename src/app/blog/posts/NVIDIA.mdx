## iBuyPower Preps Its Next-Gen Pre-Built PC Lineup With NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti GPUs
While the unveiling of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 "Blackwell" Gaming GPUs is still a few days away, we have seen several retail and online listings for the graphics cards. These GPUs will launch later in January, but it looks like everyone is excited to have them listed on the official web pages. So let's see what these pre-builts offer for the gaming community.

iBuyPower is listing at least four pre-built gaming PCs with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 50 GPUs, mainly the RTX 5080 and the RTX 5070 Ti. It's interesting to see that the 5070 Ti has been listed instead of the RTX 5070. The PCs come in both Intel and AMD options, supporting the latest chips such as the Arrow Lake "Core Ultra 200S" or the Zen 5 "Ryzen 9000" lineup. The PCs are equipped with up to 800W "Gold" PSUs and feature 32 GB of DDR5-5200 memory along with AIO liquid cooling.

Interestingly, these models are also listed in "SUPER" flavors, but that could just be an error since the previous listings included 4080 and 4070 Ti SUPER models too, so whoever updated the page forgot to remove the "SUPER" nomenclature. We don't expect any "SUPER" variant for the RTX 50 series launching next year. No prices have been mentioned for either Pre-built.

## NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 16 GB Graphics Card

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card will be based on the PG144/147-SKU45 PCB and will incorporate the GB203-400-A1 GPU die. This card will utilize the full GB203 GPU die with 84 SMs and 10,752 cores, but that's a big -51% reduction compared to the RTX 5090. For comparison, the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 had a -40 percent difference in the number of cores, so the overall performance is going to vary by a huge margin.

Other than that, the RTX 5080 is also going to feature half the VRAM configuration with a 16 GB capacity running across a 256-bit bus interface while utilizing GDDR7 modules. The graphics card will feature the fastest GDDR7 memory on the market, offering up to 32 Gbps speeds for 1024 GB/s or 1 TB/s of total bandwidth. The graphics card will feature a 400W TBP. This will be a 25% increase in the power wall, but once again, the real-world figures should be very different.

## NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Graphics Card

For the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, NVIDIA will be leveraging the GB203-300-A1 GPU core on the PG147-SKU60 PCB. This chip is expected to feature 8960 CUDA cores, so a little less than the RTX 5080 but with the same memory specifications of 16 GB VRAM running across a 256-bit wide bus interface. It will feature slower GDDR7 speeds of 28 Gbps but will still end up offering almost 1 TB/s bandwidth (896 GB/s to be precise). The card is expected to feature a TBP of around 300-350W.

NVIDIA's CES 2025 unveiling of its next-gen gaming GPU lineup is a few days away, so stay tuned for a jam-packed presentation of the GeForce RTX 50 "Blackwell" Gaming lineup.
