The rate at which the details of MediaTek’s 2025 flagship chipset, the Dimensity 9500, are racing through, it appears that we will know all there is to know about the new silicon by next month. On this occasion, a tipster has shared additional information about the SoC, mentioning that the Dimensity 9500 will adopt the new ‘Travis’ & ‘Gelas’ CPU architecture, which ARM has yet to announce, so let us dive in immediately.

## The remaining specifications of the Dimensity 9500 shared by the tipster are consistent with previous rumors that arrived this week
Not much is known about the ‘Travis’ & ‘Gelas’ CPU architecture, but tipster Digital Chat Station has mentioned that the Dimensity 9500 will include a cluster of Cortex-X930 and Cortex-A730 cores. In the latest post on Weibo, the ‘2 + 6’ configuration is the same as the one we reported previously, indicating that MediaTek will shift away from its current ‘1 + 3 + 4’ cluster and adopt a similar approach to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite and Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2.
