Apple's keynote event for the year is now in the rear-view mirror and, predictably, Wall Street analysts have started going public with their number-crunching exercises for the new iPhone lineup, leading to some interesting inferences.

For one, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives senses a massive pent-up demand for the new iPhone 17 lineup: As such, Ives still expects a supercycle for Apple to materialize in the next 12 to 18 months, aided by an expected Apple Intelligence revamp in the spring of 2026.

Meanwhile, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani believes the new Apple Watch might be eligible for an HSA-approved designation, courtesy of its blood pressure sensing abilities: For the benefit of those who might not be aware, an HSA-approved device is one that can be purchased using pre-tax funds from a Health Savings Account.

Do note that the Apple Watch Ultra 3 allows for the detection of blood pressure patterns over time and might not be as accurate as a medical-grade device. Finally, UBS analyst David Vogt has performed a back-of-the-envelope calculation, concluding that Apple's ASP is likely to rise by 3.5 percent, tempered by a higher Bill of Materials (BoM) resulting from the jettisoning of 128GB storage configuration in the base, Air, and Pro variants of the iPhone 17: "Assuming the same production and sell-through mix as last year, on a blended basis with the Base and Pro Max accounting for roughly 2/3 of iPhone sales, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests pricing could be up roughly 3.5% YoY. As an offset, dropping the 128G storage configuration in 3 models (Base, Air, and Pro) could increase the blended iPhone BOM by around 1.5% - 2.0% slightly offsetting the uplift from price."
