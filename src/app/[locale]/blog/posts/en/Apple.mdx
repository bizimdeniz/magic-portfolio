The arrival of the iPhone SE 4 sometime in the first quarter of next year will signal that Apple is gearing up to reduce its dependency on Qualcomm as the ‘affordable’ model is said to be the first to ship with the company’s in-house 5G modem codenamed Centauri. By setting up its own supply chain for baseband chips, Apple will no longer have to pay Qualcomm a hefty premium, which only means that it will have the flexibility to price the iPhone SE 4 competitively. Now, according to the latest information provided through a Japanese telecommunications channel, the upcoming handset is said to be priced under $500, making it ooze exceptional value compared to the iPhone 16 series, which starts from $799 in the U.S.

## The iPhone SE 4 will be one of the most affordable handsets to support Apple Intelligence, making its price point even more attractive to the masses

The pricing update comes from yeux1122’s blog on Naver, with the tipster mentioning that the retail price of the iPhone SE 4 in Japan will be under $500. In terms of value, the figure is exceptional, and while it is more expensive than the $429 launch price of the iPhone SE 3, customers are said to experience a bevy of changes, both internal and external. Previously, we reported about the entire specifications sheet of the iPhone SE 4 that also included its estimated price in the $499 to $549 range, which would likely be for the different storage tiers.

For that amount, customers should expect the iPhone SE 4’s internals to include an A18 SoC, 8GB RAM, a large 6.06-inch OLED screen that will lack ProMotion support, but overall, the configuration is highly compelling. The base iPhone 16, which is available for $799 in the U.S., also ships with an A18 chipset and 8GB RAM, so to see that Apple is going down the somewhat affordable route should make its competitors extremely nervous.

Also, thanks to the improved Neural Engine of the A18 and the increased RAM count, the iPhone SE 4 is slated to be Apple’s most affordable model to support generative AI features. Given that Apple’s path to becoming a $4 trillion company will be aided by the firm’s expansion of generative AI features, the iPhone SE 4 should easily add fuel to that fire.

While we estimate that the launch will happen in the first quarter, Apple is expected to kick off 2025 with the release of the M4 MacBook Air family, so we will have to be just a little patient for the official unveiling.
