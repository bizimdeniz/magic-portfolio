It's rumored that Call of Duty will be receiving an additional premium pass for the Squid Game event that is coming soon to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone. The event was officially teased yesterday, where it's said that those who participate in the event will be able to get skins of operatives themed around the hit TV show, as well as blueprints of weapons and other content that fits the Squid Game theme. The crossover event is set to begin on January 3, but more details haven't been released.

This is already causing quite a stir from both Squid Game fans and Call of Duty fans, with some saying that they're completely missing the point of the TV show. The TV show is all about living in a dystopian, capitalist world where people are willing to fight to the death for money. The show just recently got a second season, which was released yesterday on Netflix.
The rumor of the premium pass comes from a user called xFleXy_ on X, where they posted a screenshot of a message that pops up when you load the game. The message reads as the following:

Squid Game arrives in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone. Explore an exhilarating Event Pass, where the Premium Track route allows for more incredible rewards, including the Front Man Operator. Plus, a myriad of LTM's will feature signature sinister takes on Red Light/Green Light mechanics.

A lot of people also have issues with the game having premium battle passes due to the fact that a significant amount of people who purchased the game would have paid at least $70 for it rather than playing it via Xbox Game Pass for the long haul. Seeing a paid game with a ton of microtransactions is never a great feeling, and it makes more sense for the event pass to be in Call of Duty: Warzone, as that is the free-to-play Battle Royale set in the CoD universe.

It hasn't been specified how much this pass will cost as of yet, but as the event looms closer, there will most likely be new details given about the event and the rewards that you will be able to obtain by participating.
