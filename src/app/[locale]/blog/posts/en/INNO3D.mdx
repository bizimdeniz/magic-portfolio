## Inno3D Prepares NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 iChill X3D, Box Confirms 32 GB GDDR7 Memory
In an exclusive leak by Videocardz, we got to see the first custom AIB variant of the upcoming flagship NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card. The flagship succeeds the GeForce RTX 4090 and is among the first to launch in the Blackwell lineup. While the GPU isn't confirmed for a retail launch this month, it's expected that the GPU will be unveiled at CES.

So, we may see both the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 together, and possibly the RTX 5070 Ti. As leaked online, this is the Inno3D GeForce RTX 5090 iChill X3 edition, which succeeds the Inno3D GeForce RTX 4090 iChill X3 and has some visible differences on the cooler shroud. The GPU does feature a triple-fan configuration similar to the predecessor as well as RGB lighting, but the design is quite different.

From the leaked GPU box, we can see that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 comes with 32 GB GDDR7 VRAM as was reported previously. This is the first gaming GPU to offer such a huge VRAM configuration and will have a 512-bit memory bus to deliver up to 1792 GB/s of memory bandwidth. Apart from the memory capacity, the box also shows its thickness, which is 3.5-slot. This was expected since flagship NVIDIA GPUs are quite bulkier and the RTX 5090 brings significantly upgraded specs over the RTX 4090.

The thickness of the Founders Edition model isn't known yet, but it could come out to be 3-slot at minimum. We didn't get to see the power connector on the RTX 5090 iChill X3, but reports suggest that it will feature a single 12-pin 12V-2x6 connector that can feed the GPU up to 600W. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 is reported to boast a TBP of 575W, the AIB editions may go higher.

Since one of the custom editions of the GeForce RTX 5090 has been unveiled, expect NVIDIA to reveal it officially at CES. However, there are no reports that confirm that the flagship will have a retail launch on 21st January alongside the RTX 5080.
