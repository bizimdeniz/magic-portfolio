Countless Nintendo Switch 2 rumors have circulated over the past couple of years, but none had nailed down the new console's launch date yet. A few hours ago, the Italian website UAGNA shared the rumor that Nintendo Switch 2 accessories (first-party as well as third-party ones) will launch on the market on March 28. As such, they believe this to be the release date for the console, too.

To begin with, we must take this with a big grain of salt. That said, it's not completely out of the realm of possibility. In fact, last month, another rumor pointed to a January reveal and a subsequent late March debut for the console. Just a few days ago, we learned that the date for the announcement could be January 8, 2025.
